//add ways in order to interact with the tasks and projects button

//when going to the tasks i will see the general tasks
//and there will be a plus sign button somewhere in order
//to add new notes

// when i go to the projects i will see all the current
//projects, there will be a plus button to add new projects
//once i create a new project i will go in it and 
// there i can add new tasks.

//each task will have a delete button and by pressing a 
// task it will expand. The same thing goes for the 
// projects button.

//I want to be able to edit all the details for each task
//and project
